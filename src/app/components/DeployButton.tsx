  <overview>
    <user-summary>
      AI Task Management is a streamlined application that leverages AI to intelligently prioritize and manage tasks. Users can input tasks, and the AI will automatically assign priorities and suggest deadlines.
    </user-summary>
    <technical-metadata>
      This project is built using Next.js and deployed with Cloudflare next-on-pages.  It integrates with a mock AI service to provide intelligent task prioritization. The frontend is built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and includes interactive elements with Framer Motion.

    <styling>
      The application will have a clean and modern user interface with a focus on usability. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, providing a consistent and responsive design. A calming color palette will be employed to reduce visual clutter and improve the user experience.

    This component allows users to add new tasks.
    - Purpose:  To capture user input for new tasks and trigger the task creation process.
    - Prop Interface:
      - `onTaskCreated`:  A function that is called when the user adds a new task.  It takes the task description (string) as an argument.
    - State Management: useState for the input field value.
    - Mock Event Handling: The `onTaskCreated` prop is called with the current input value when the form is submitted.
    - Style: Tailwind CSS for styling (input field, button, and basic layout).
    - Animation: None.

<component>
  <path>src/app/components/DeployButton.tsx</path>
  <description>
    "use client";
    This component simulates deploying the application.
    - Purpose:  To provide a visual representation of the deployment process.
    - Prop Interface: None.
    - State Management: useState for a `deploying` boolean.
    - Mock Event Handling:  When the button is clicked, set `deploying` to `true`, simulate a deployment delay (setTimeout), then set `deploying` back to `false`.
    - Style: Tailwind CSS for styling (button and loading indicator). Use a green color scheme.
    - Animation: Use Framer Motion to animate the button during the deployment process (e.g., a rotating loading icon).
